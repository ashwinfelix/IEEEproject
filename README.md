Medium question\n
A stateless widget can be thought of like a poster that you cant change once its printed.Its for showing content that does'nt need to change based on interactions.While a stateful widget can be thought of like a whiteboard where you can write or erase things whenever you want.It holds information that might change based on user interaction or other events.

In flutter you can set the state with the setState() function.
